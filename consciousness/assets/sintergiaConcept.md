'Reality' can be conceived of as an undifferentiated energetic matrix. By means of 
the brain, this matrix is converted into neuronal activity and experience. This paper 
explores the manner in which human experience occurs by analyzing the charac- 
teristics of information present in space, the events associated with brain activity, 
and the interaction between the two. Human experience is considered to constitute 
or 'exist in' a dimension different from that which is related to the localized physio- 
logical activity of the brain. Between cerebral electrochemical changes and the 
experiences themselves of light, sound, love, fear, etc., energetic transformations 
of a qualitative nature must take place. These postulated transformations are 
discussed and a new theory (the syntergic theory) concerning the creation of 
experience is presented. 
1. Introduction 
The way in which neuronal activity is transformed into conscious experience is the most 
elusive problem facing the field of biology today. There are at least four different though 
interrelated theoretical approaches that have been applied to this issue: 
(1) Emergent properties approach. According to this set of ideas, conscious experience 
appears when neuronal activity reaches a certain level of complexity. A dimensional 
change is postulated involving the transformation of neuronal energy into another 
energetic state more related to consciousness (Grinberg-Zylberbaum, 1976b). 
(2) Psychoneural identity approach. Partisans of this view hold that experience and 
neuronal activity are identical. Since a neuronal pattern is a pattern of experience, 
there is no necessity to propose any type of energetic transformation (Fernandez 
Guardiola, 1979). 
(3) Independence approach. This position maintains that the brain is merely a tool 
used by the 'real observer' to make contact with physical reality. This observer 
(being) transforms neuronal patterns into experience but is itself independent of 
the process. Consciousness is considered to be independent from but interrdated 
to neuronal activity (Don Lucio, 1980). 
(4) Unity approach. Following this line of reasoning, the individual brain is conceived 
of as a part or an element of a larger brain-that which really experiences. The 
individual brain only focalizes experiences (Cooke, 1976). procedural outline (Neisser, 1967) 
My own position with regard to this problem has moved from the first to the last 
approach over time. As will be elucidated in this paper, I now conceptualize conscious 
experience as an interaction between an energetic field (neuronal field) activated by the 
individual brain and the structure of space. The analysis begins with a discussion about 
a phenomenon (iconic phenomenon) that suggests some very interesting neurophysiological 
possibilities. 
In 1961, Averback & Coriell demonstrated that a visual pointer (bar marker) presented 
after a display of letters had been removed permitted selected portions to be 'looked at' 
by subjects. The interval between the presentation of the display and the pointer could 
be varied from tens to hundreds of milliseconds without disturbing this phenomenon. 
During the interval, the information contained in the original visual display (see Fig. 1) 
is 
transduced by the retina, transmitted through the optic nerves, and activates the 
thalamus, visual cortex and related structures. The bar marker presented after this series 
of events is able to retrieve the image of an absent and predecodified letter. Furthermore, 
if a circle is presented instead of the marker, the icon (visual image of the letter) is erased 
(Neisser, 1967). This retroactive masking effect blocks the conscious experience of the visual 
icon even though it has been almost completely physiologically decoded and processed. 
It has been postulated (Grinberg-Zylberbaum, 1976a) that one of the basic operations 
performed by the visual system is the inclusion of information in neuronal hierarchically- 
ordered convergent levels, each one of which has the capacity to unify information that 
is dispersed at lower levels. The operation of unification involves the extraction of 'neuro- 
algorithms'-logical structures of complex neuronal patterns-and the activation of new 
dimensions of functional activity, such as the 'neuronal field' which will be discussed later. 
Each neuroalgorithm conveys information about form, position and meaning in its neuro- 
logical structure. 
The retrieval of visual information takes places after part of the neuroalgorithm is 
Conscious experience and the brain 
203 
stimulated: divergence circuits reactivate the original cortical neuronal population that was 
activated when the stimulus was initially presented. This retrieval involves the excitation 
of the visual system by means of a triggering stimulus either similar or related to the 
original one. 
In Averbach & Coriell's experiment, the visual icon of a letter is seen when a bar marker 
occupying the same position in space is presented. It is proposed that the neuronal codifi- 
cation of a letter involves the activation of a neuroalgorithm which is represented in a 
hierarchically convergent polysensorial population of neurons as a complex pattern of 
neuronal discharges, containing in its structure the form, level of illumination, position, 
etc. of the letter. The bar marker is also codified as a neuroalgorithm having at least its 
position in common with the one representing the letter. This shared feature is able to 
activate the entire neuroalgorithm of the letter, and thus to stimulate divergence circuits 
which effect the corresponding cortical neuronal activation. Therefore, subjects see an 
absent letter when a bar marker occupying the same position is presented. 
The retroactive masking phenomenon has a similar physiological basis except that a 
new factor-the complexity of the neuroalgorithm representing a circle-is introduced. The 
visual icon is lost due to the complexity of this neuroalgorithm which competes with that 
representing the letter. In this case the divergence circuits are not able to convey any organ- 
ized information and retrieval does not take place. 
2. The transformation of neuronal patterns into experience 
Studies concerning the characteristic electrophysiological responses that are evoked in the 
visual system as a result of the presentation of a stimulus have shown that their morphology 
and even their temporal features are dependent upon at least two types of processes which 
can be typified as exogeneous, representing the physical form, and endogenous, representing 
the meaning of a stimulus (John, 1972; John, Bartlett, Shimokochi & Kleinmann, 1973). 
Moreover, it was demonstrated in 1974 that the form of a letter and its meaning are pro- 
cessed in different cerebral locations (Grinberg-Zylberbaum & John, 1979). This was 
accomplished by recording and averaging potentials evoked by an identical stimulus that 
could be placed in two different meaningful contexts (the letter '1' and the number '1') 
and two different stimuli that have a single meaning ('capital A' and 'small a', varying in size). 
The results show that similar averaged evoked potentials (AEPs) are recorded in the 
occipital cortex when the letter '1' and the number '1' are presented, while dissimilar AEPs 
are recorded in the parietal cortex under the same circumstances (Fig. :2). The differences 
in the morphology of the AEPs registered in the parietal cortex appear 150-190ms after 
the stimulus is presented, indicating that the decodification of meaning has taken place 
by this time. In contrast, the potentials evoked by the 'capital A' and 'little a' differ signifi- 
cantly only in the occipital cortex (Fig. 3). Thus, it has been concluded that the form of a 
letter is processed in the occipital cortex while its meaning is processed in the parietal cortex. 
It can be postulated that the perception of form is the outcome of the activation of an 
extensive population of neurons located in the occipital cortex, while the cognition of mean- 
ing arises from the activation of 'neuroalgorithms' which have the power to unify poly- 
sensory, highly convergent populations of neurons into a neuronal pattern. 
The above-mentioned concepts and their derivatives describe some of the neurological 
correlates of the visual perception of form, position, etc., and the attribution of meaning. 
Theoretical models which describe the processes of logic and language in terms of neuro- 
physiological events as well as neuroalgorithms have already been formulated (Grinberg- 
Zylberbaum, 1976b). 


Fig. 2. Averaged evoked potentials (AEPs, n = 100) elicited by a vertical line 
presented in a numeral (lines 1 and 5} and in an alphabetical (lines 2 and 6) con- 
text. They were recorded in three subjects (S.J., L.T., d.C.) in different areas 
of the brain (P4, parietal; Ts,6, temporal; 01,2, occipital). Statistically significant 
differences were obtained in the parietal and temporal AEP components located 
between 150-190ms of latency. The difference wave and t-test were calculated 
using a PDP-12 computer (Grinberg-Zylberbaum & John, 1979) 
A completely different inventory of concepts must be developed in order to attempt 
to explain the foundations of conscious experience, since this phenomenon takes place 
in a dimension distinct from that of neuronal activation. Thus, in endeavoring to under- 
stand conscious experience as an experience in itself, the consideration of neural events 
and neuroalgorithms is pointless. In other words, the experience of light as light, of sound 
as sound, and even of meaning as meaning cannot be located per se in the activity of any 
neuronal population which has been described so far. 
The dimension of experience is different froha the dimension of neuronal activity. 
Nevertheless, it is possible to measure the interval after which the conscious experience 
of a stimulus 'occurs' by means of recording the evoked potentials (Cansesco, Torres, 
Riefkohl & Grinberg-Zylberbaum, 1978). In our laboratory, this interval has been found 
to be about 100 ms.

(01) location. Lower tracing, similar calculations applied to AEPs recorded in one

What are the processes during that 100 ms after stimulus presention which result in a 
conscious experience of the stimulus? In order to answer this question, two concepts will 
first be introduced that must be taken into account: the 'syntergic' organization of space 
and the 'neuronal field'. 
3. Syntergie organization of space 
We don't perceive objects; rather, we perceive information located in space in the form 
of energy patterns. The 'syntergic' (derived from the words synthesis and energy) 
organization of space is defined as the organization of information located in space in 
the form of complex patterns of energy. One of its most interesting features is the con- 
centration of information at each point. For example, large amounts of information ean 
be received and visualized when an observer looks through a pinhole made in a piece of 
paper. What the eye 'sees' is the space of the pinhole. However, if the pinhole is oriented 
towards a star-studded sky, information emanating from thousands of stars is concentrated 
in the form of complex energy patterns in the space of that pinhole. 
The quantity of information concentrated in a point of space 'depends, among other 
variables, on the position of the point relative to the source(s) of information. For example, 
206 
J. Grinberg-Zylberbaum 
if the pinhole is located a meter away from a star, the quantity of information concerning 
the star concentrated in that space will be less than if the same pinhole is located light years 
away from the star. In this latter location with a sufficiently powerful telescope (for the 
purposes of illustration), we could see all the features visible in the former location and 
much more besides. Therefore, all the information concentrated at the pinhole at a meter's 
distance is also present at a pinhole light years away. 
Obviously, the extent of space from which information is gathered increases with the 
distance of the pinhole from the source(s) of information. In other words, the source(s) 
of information and the point of reference that intercepts the dimension of space in which 
that information is concentrated as energy patterns could be visualized as describing a 
cone. A high syntergic space is differentiated from a low syntergic space on the basis of 
the amount of information in a given segment of space (the greater the amount of infor- 
mation and the smaller the space, the higher the 'syntergy'). Thus, a high syntergic space 
has a large amount of information concentrated at each point. 
The space-matter continuum can actually be conceived of as a syntergic continuum 
in which one extreme (matter) concentrates less information (is less convergent) and the 
other (space) more information (is more convergent). The property of redundancy is 
associated with that of convergence, such that a high syntergic space is more redundant 
(different portions contain similar information) than a low syntergic space. Redundancy 
of information increases as a direct function of the distance between the source of infor- 
mation and a point of reference. 
The following common situation is a good example of redundancy: If an observer is 
travelling on the surface of the earth and looks towards the moon, he will notice that the 
moon 'follows' his movements. At the same time, the objects near his path appear blurred 
and are swiftly left behind. The only explanation of this amazing fact is that information 
about the moon is found in redundant form in the many portions of space through which 
the observer passes. Each point in space (at the distance from the moon to the observer) 
contains similar information and so the observer sees the same image, independent of the 
speed at which he travels. In contrast, objects located near him are not found in a redun- 
dant form in the space that is traversed, and so they appear blurred. 
The two syntergic properties mentioned so far, concentration-convergence of infor- 
mation and redundancy, are interrelated in the sense that as one of them increases, so 
does the other. As the syntergic continuum can be considered to be synonymous with 
the space-matter continuum, other properties can be deduced as well. The first and most 
mysterious of these are gravitational forces. Whenever an observer approaches a high syn- 
tergic space, that is, a space in which there is a high concentration and redundancy of infor- 
mation at each point, the gravitational force diminishes with respect to a low syntergic 
space. It is interesting to speculate that what we call gravity might only reflect a change in 
syntergic organization. 
Physical time is also related to the syntergy of a space: time 'goes faster' in a low syn- 
tergic space and 'slower' in a high syntergic space. It is proposed that time can be measured 
only when changes in the organization of information in space are taking place. Thus, 
physical time will 'go faster' in a space in which pronounced organizational changes are 
occurring. For instance, it has been shown that physical time as measured by initially syn- 
chronized atomic clocks passes more quickly in the proximity of a large as opposed to a 
small gravitational mass. A high syntergic space characterized by a high level of redundancy 
is relatively more homogeneous than a low syntergic space; therefore, time will pass more 
rapidly in the latter situation. The fact that time slows down as the speed of light is 
approached, as predicted by Einstein, is in accordance with these theoretical concepts. 
Conscious experience and the brain 
207 
A maximally high syntergic space would be equivalent to a space traversed at the speed 
of light. 
There is also a correlation between syntergy and speed: an observer moving at high speed 
is 'equivalent' to a stationary observer located in a high syntergic space, in that each inter- 
acts with a large amount of information in a small measure of time. This phenomenon 
brought to an extreme is found at the speed of light, when time disappears and the degree 
of redundancy is infinite. 
It can be said that a perceptual image is a phenomenological unity in which is concen- 
trated all the time-related neurophysiological processes which were previously activated. 
In an analogous manner, a portion of a high syntergic space can be said to concentrate 
information in a single energetic unit that has travelled different times before reaching 
that particular region. It is therefore possible to speak of the 'concentration' of time in 
portions of space. Each point in a high syntergic space can be conceived of as concentrating 
both time and information: originally located in an enormous expanse of space, they are 
found in a minute sector of it. The great concentration of information at each point gives 
rise to a highly complex organization. 
We shall see that the brain is syntergically organized as well. If the complexity of the 
syntergic organization of space exceeds the 'neurosyntergic' organization of the brain, 
that space appears to be transparent. If, on the other hand, the latter is more complex than 
the former, then the space (its content) becomes 'materialized' to perception. Matter and 
transparent space are ultimately a creation of the brain. 
In conclusion, what has been defined as high syntergy within the space-matter con- 
tinuum is characterized by: 
(1) high concentration of information, 
(2) high redundancy, 
(3) concentration of time, 
(4) great complexity, 
(5) reduced gravitational forces. 
Finally, it can be postulated that a high syntergic space is also a densely algorithmized 
space in which the information in each of its portions is shared with the others, such that 
each point contains information about the whole. 
4. Syntergic organization of the brain 
The characteristics of the syntergic organization of space that have been presented are also 
observable in the brain. In an earlier article, I have described the convergent organization 
of the neuronal circuitry of the brain (Grinberg-Zylberbaum, 1976a). One of its most 
interesting properties is the convergence of information. Ascending levels of convergence 
can be postulated which contain ever larger amounts of information (similar to space). 
Convergence and different levels of convergence are terms which refer to two different 
processes. One is the concentration of information by means of complex neuronal circuits. 
At each level, an algorithm of the former levels is produced. These algorithms can be used 
by the system to reconstruct the details of the original information but they don't contain 
the details in themselves. The other process is the concentration of information, also in 
an algofithmical form, by means of dhnensional transformations. An example of this type 
of process, which will be discussed later, is the formation of a 'neuronal field' from the 
local activity of components of the nervous system. This neuronal field would have coded 
in its morphology all the information previously contained in the separate elements. 
What is called abstract thought and conceptu~ization must involve the integration of 
208 
J. Grinberg-Zylberbaum 
information of varying orders of complexity (convergence codification). The neuronal 
information at each level of the 'convergence tree' must be organized in a very complicated 
manner and is surely associated with the activation of a myriad number of cells. Thus, 
convergent codification involves the general activation of neuronal populations. As in 
space, each increasingly convergent level contains a greater redundancy of information. 
A neurosyntergic organization of the brain as well as a neurosyntergic continuum (high 
to low) can be theorized, such that a brain functioning in a high neurosyntergic mode 
would be better able to integrate information in a unified and abstract manner, while a 
low neurosyntergic mode would involve a more concrete perception of reality. Further- 
more, a neurosyntergic/syntergic ratio can be proposed: if greater than 1 in reference to 
some space, that space would be perceived as containing matter ('materialized') and thus 
a concrete object would be seen, while if less than 1, perception would be disorganized 
and visual transparency would be the result. The development of neurosyntergy can be 
postulated as proceeding parallel to phylo- and ontogenetic development, giving rise to 
the perception of more and more complex patterns of information in increasingly evolved 
forms of life. 
5. Neuronal fields 
The activation of neuronal populations of ceils involves highly complex interactions. If 
each neuron is conceptualized as an emitter and receiver of electrochemical discharges, 
and if the transmission of each electrical charge between cells creates a local energetic 
field, then a global energetic field must be formed as a result of a population response. 
The field associated with each neural level of convergence would be incorporated into an 
even more inclusive field arising from the holistic activity of the entire brain. This field 
is called the 'neuronal field' (Grinberg-Zylberbaum, 1978). 
Although the nature of this field is unknown, there is no reason to suppose that it 
behaves differently from other fields which have been described. Thus, the neuronal field 
would expand into the space surrounding the brain and interact with the syntergic organ- 
ization of that space. The greater the neurosyntergic organization of a brain, the more 
similar the neuronal field would become to a high syntergic space. Theoretically, at some 
level of development the neuronal field could become identical to the morphology of the 
syntergic space. In this event, it is probable that the experience of the observer would 
be unified with the whole information field. 
I 
propose that what is called experience is precisely the interaction between the 
neuronal field and the syntergic organization of space. The time required to activate a 
fully operational neuronal field would be experienced as the duration of the present 
moment. This varies accordingly to the modality of the experience and is positively corre- 
lated with the level of the neurosyntergic organization of the brain. Therefore, there is 
a direct relationship between the experienced duration of the present and the level of 
neurosynterglc functioning. 
6. Gravitational changes and the neuronal field 
The interaction between the neuronal field and the syntergic organization of space could 
result in mutual alterations. A neuronal field from a high neurosyntergic brain might increase 
the syntergy of the surrounding space, while a change in the syntergic organization of space 
might alter the morphology of the neuronal fields located within that space and thus activate 
different modalities of experience. 
Conscious experience and the brain 
209 
If gravitational forces reflect changes in the syntergetic organization of space, then it 
can be postulated that gravitational shifts would occur in the proximity of a brain in the 
process of a neurosyntergic change. It was recently demonstrated that an increase in brain 
coherence as measured in EEG recordings alters the gravitational field, thus supporting 
the existence of a neuronal field and its possible interaction with the syntergic continuum 
(Grinberg-Zylberbaum & Tabachnick, 1979). 
7. Localization of experience 
If experience is the interaction of neuronal fields with the syntergic organization of space, 
experience can 'occur' at any location where this interaction takes place. Human beings 
are accustomed to consider the body as the origin and the center of experience. I propose 
that with adequate training in the attainment of certain mental states (neurosyntergic 
modalities), the site of experience could appear outside the human body. 
The focusing of experience must be regulated by an additional factor besides the inter- 
action of fields since our experience is localized in space and time. This can be called the 
'directionality factor' and must be related to changes in the energetic morphology of the 
interacting fields. Research on the characteristics and modes of action of the directionality 
factor are needed in order to demonstrate its existence and properties. 
Thus, the interaction between neuronal fields and the syntergic organization of space 
constitutes an event that we sense as experience. Different modalities of experience would 
depend on the energetic, situational and morphological properties of the interacting fields. 
8. Interactions between neuronal fields 
It is proposed that what is called reality or experience is the interaction between our 
neuronal field and the syntergic organization of space and other neuronal fields. Reciprocal 
influences can be postulated, such that a single neuronal field could affect and be affected 
by the morphology and energetic organization of the fields with which it interacts. 
Techniques are now being developed for the stimulation of what could be called 'direct 
communication' between subjects, thought to be made possible by an interaction between 
individual neuronal fields. The simultaneous EEG activity of subjects has been recorded 
during intervals in which this sort of communication has been attempted (Grinberg- 
Zylberbaum, Cueli & Szydlo, 1978; Grinberg-Zylberbaum, Cueli, Szydlo, Villanueva & 
Tabachnick, 1979). 
We have found that there is a high degree of correspondence between the level of com- 
munication attained and the coherence of the subjects' EEG recordings. It is possible to 
define two types of cummunication: 'symbiotic' and 'mature'. The former is characterized 
by an apparent loss of identity or ego-independence and is associated with the EEG patterns 
of the subjects being 90 ° out of phase, with respect to coherence. That is to say, when the 
coherence of one EEG increases, the other diminishes. At the same time, the morphology 
of the EEG patterns recorded in zone Ts of both subjects are correlated to a high degree. 
In mature communcation, both subjects share common feelings, images and thoughts 
but without losing their individuality. The EEG recordings show that during this type of 
direct communication, both brains undergo a simultaneous increase in coherence. 
It is important to remember that according to the ideas presented in this paper, an 
increase in redundancy (in this case, an increase in coherence) is related to an increase in 
neurosyntergy, such that the neurosyntergy/syntergy ratio becomes smaller. It is logical 
that two subjects could establish direct communication under these conditions since in some 
sense they have become more unified with the structure of space.
