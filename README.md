# Sintergia: Pattern-Based AI Agent System

## Overview
Sintergia is an advanced AI agent system that leverages vector databases to create a sophisticated lattice memory structure for pattern recognition and analysis across multiple domains. Inspired by Jacobo Grimberg's theories, the system explores the intersection of collective consciousness, quantum mechanics, and information processing.

## Core Architecture

### Memory Lattice Structure
The system utilizes Pinecone vector databases to create a multi-dimensional memory lattice with specialized indices:

```python
memory_lattice = {
    'social': PineconeIndex('social-patterns'),
    'market': PineconeIndex('market-patterns'),
    'blockchain': PineconeIndex('blockchain-patterns'),
    'unified': PineconeIndex('unified-patterns')
}
```

Each index serves a specific purpose:
- Social Index: Captures and analyzes social network interaction patterns
- Market Index: Stores and processes market behavior patterns
- Blockchain Index: Maintains transaction and blockchain activity patterns
- Unified Index: Synthesizes complex patterns across domains

## Key Features
